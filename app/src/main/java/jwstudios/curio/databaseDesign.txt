//TODO data index
figure out indexes - probably can make the indexes after we figure out typical queries
seems like we'll have lots of joins between Answer.answer and OptionXYZ.option

//TODO data flow
lets have all data in mysql somewhere. then, on sqlite store only content this user can see?
so, on load, load all data querying from local sqlite and display
then show the 'refreshing' symbol, and have data pumped into sqlite, then redraw the page with new content

//TODO local cache data
should only have a subset of all the data in mysql. users imported should only be for 'friends'
questions pulled in should only be questions targeted to you or created by you
answers pulled in should only be for the questions pulled in (do we pull in all answers right away? maybe not..)
